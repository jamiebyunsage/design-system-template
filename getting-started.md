## Introduction
In the process of internal desktop applications development, many different design specs and implementations would be involved, which might cause designers and developers difficulties and duplication and reduce the efficiency of development. After massive project practice and summaries, Ant Design, a design language for background applications, is refined by Ant UED Team, which aims to uniform the user interface specs for internal background projects, lower the unnecessary cost of design differences and implementation and liberate the resources of design and front-end development.

## Design Principles
Here is where you take the time to explain the principles that are encapsulated in the entire design system. These principles will manifest themselves in different ways, from high-level guidelines to low-level components.


## Practices & Cases
Provide information on how to properly link up design system files in order to create a basic "hello world" template. From there, describe the process of incorporating design system's components into the project. Again, this will undoubtedly vary based on the setup and technologies your organization utilizes.
